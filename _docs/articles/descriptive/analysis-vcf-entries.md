**Table**: VCF FILTER Entries
<table border="1">
	<tr>
		<th>Entry</th>
		<th>DEscription</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>IndelConflict</td>
		<td>Locus is in region with conflicting indel calls</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>SiteConflict</td>
		<td>Site genotype conflicts with proximal indel call, typically a heterozygous SNV call made inside of a heterozygous deletion</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>LowGQX</td>
		<td>Locus GQX is less than 30 or not present</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>HighDPFRatio</td>

	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>HighSNVSB</td>
		<td>SNV strand bias value (SNVSB) exceeds 10</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>HighDepth</td>
		<td>Locus depth is greater than 3x the mean chromosome depth</td>

	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>DPI</td>
		<td>Read depth associated with indel, taken from the position preceding the indel.</td>
